$ podded.py help
podded - Saves your podman build instructions, run commands and systemd (quadlet) service files - all in a single script.

podded solves the inconvenience of having to manage run command, Containerfile and quadlet file in a single self-modifying script:
* Stores the Containerfile inside the script
* Saves and reuses your podman run command after the first use
* Automatically generates and manages quadlet files for systemd
